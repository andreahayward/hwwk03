For this homework assignment - 
I first created variables to use in my code. Two sets - one to use for the prompts and another to use to actually generate the random password. I set the password length to be between 7 - 129 to account for the actual count starting at 0, allowing the user to actually select 8 or 128 as their password length. I set an alert if they chose a value outside that length and stopped them from generating the password. I then set confirms for the user to select what type of items they wanted in their password, and wrote else if statements to cover all the different scenarios. I used the Math Floor and Math Random function to then generate the password based on their selections.
